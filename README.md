## About the Game
- developed in Model View Controller (MVC) architecture design.
- uses firebase as database to store results.
- playable with keyboard, no touch screen - didnt think about it when developing.
- spiders (enemies) move towards the main character.
- main can either shoot a spider or die or be eaten or loose it's mind due to arachnophobia, up to user.

## Improvements
- adding different movements of spiders.
- adding different levels.
- maybe account creation to keep the most recent level finished.
- maybe: automate generation of new levels.
